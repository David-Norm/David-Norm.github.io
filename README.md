      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        My name is David Norman. I am currently a senior at the University of Washington, Tacoma, 
        pursuing my Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science. I have a minor in Business Data Analytics, 
        leading me to be someone who is dedicated to leveraging data analytics to drive sustainable 
        business growth and inform strategic decisions.
      </p>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I have two children, a 5 year old daughter and a 1 year old son. There are many hobbies I enjoy 
        such as rock climbing, soccer, and video games. Since I grew up surrounded by technology, my 
        father and siblings were always deeply engaged with computers and how they worked, and 
        naturally, I followed their lead. From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by how computers 
        operate and how meaningful insights can be created from the data they provide. This curiosity 
        has evolved into a passion for using technology and data to develop innovative ideas and make 
        informed decisions about the future.

## Projects 
### Drippy Spelunk Video Game
![DrippySpelunk](DrippySpelunkPicture.jpg)
- Project: https://github.com/David-Norm/DrippySpelunk
- This project is a Dungeon Crawler styled game created in Java with a SQL database implementation where a character will run around a dungeon looking for four pillars to collect. After collecting all the pillars the exit door will open. There are many fun ideas implemented such as collecting chests with items, custom dungeon generation, and turn based enemy combat.
- Implemented using multiple design patterns such as MVC, Singleton, Factory, and Facade.
- Key Learnings: Design patterns, SQL database implementation, and object-oriented programming.
- Technologies used were Java, SQL, IntelliJIDEA, and GitHub.
### Spreadsheet
![Spreadsheet](SpreadsheetPicture.jpg)
- Project: https://github.com/David-Norm/Spreadsheet
- This program is a Java based spreadsheet application modeled after Excel. It evaluates cell formulas using a tree-structured data model, made possible through an adjacency-list graph and topological sorting for dependency resolution. The spreadsheet also includes a custom grammar implementation that serves as the expression parser for evaluating cell formulas.
- Key Learnings: Grammar implementation, GUI implementation, and tree-structured data models.
- Technologies used were Java, IntelliJIDEA, and GitHub.
### Tetris
![Tetris](TetrisPicture.jpg)
- Project: https://github.com/David-Norm/Tetris
- This program was created in Java to understand object-oriented programming. This video game has two gamemodes: Normal and Hyper Mode. There is a choice of grid activation for easier gameplay, and optional use of music. There is also a progression bar to show what level you are on and what score you achieved. 
- Key Learnings: State design pattern, object-oriented programming, and Audio implementation.
- Technologies used were Java, IntelliJIdea, and GitHub.

## Experience
I have developed substantial experience through a wide range of coding projects at the University of Washington Tacoma. These projects have strengthened my understanding of object-oriented programming, design patterns, and database implementation across multiple programming languages. They have also provided practical, hands-on exposure to building software systems, collaborating in team environments, and applying theoretical concepts to real world problems.

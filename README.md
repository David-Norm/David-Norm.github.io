# David Norman's Portfolio

## Overview

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### Introduction
My name is David Norman. I am currently a senior at the University of Washington, Tacoma, pursuing my Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science. I also hold a minor in Business Data Analytics, which strengthens my ability to leverage data to drive sustainable business growth and support strategic decision-making.

### About Me
I have two beautiful children, a 5 year old daughter and 1 year old son, who keep me very active. There are many hobbies I enjoy such as rock climbing, music, and video games. Since I grew up surrounded by technology, my father and siblings were always deeply engaged with computers, and naturally, I followed their lead. From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by how computers operate and how meaningful insights can be drawn from the data they produce. This curiosity has evolved into a passion for using technology and analytics to develop innovative ideas and make informed decisions about the future.

# Projects

## Drippy Spelunk Video Game

<table>
<tr>
<td width="55%" valign="top">

Drippy Spelunk is a dungeon crawler video game developed in Java with SQL integration. The player explores a custom-generated dungeon, collecting four pillars to unlock the exit. The game features chest items, randomized dungeon generation, and turn-based enemy combat. It was implemented using design patterns such as MVC, Singleton, Factory, and Facade. Through this project, I gained experience with object-oriented programming, SQL integration, and applying multiple design patterns in a single software system. The technologies used include Java, SQL, IntelliJ IDEA, and GitHub.

## Spreadsheet

<table>
<tr>
<td width="55%" valign="top">

The Spreadsheet project is a fully functional Java-based application modeled after Excel. It evaluates cell formulas using a tree-structured data model supported by an adjacency-list graph and topological sorting. The spreadsheet includes a custom grammar for parsing expressions and computing results efficiently. This project enhanced my skills in grammar construction, GUI implementation, and tree-based data models. The technologies used include Java, IntelliJ IDEA, and GitHub.

## Tetris

<table>
<tr>
<td width="55%" valign="top">

Tetris is a Java-based video game featuring two modes: Normal and Hyper. It includes optional music, visual grid assistance for gameplay, and a progression system that displays the player’s level and score. This project allowed me to apply the State design pattern and strengthen my understanding of object-oriented programming while implementing audio integration. The technologies used for this project include Java, IntelliJ IDEA, and GitHub.

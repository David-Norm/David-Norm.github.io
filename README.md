      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        My name is David Norman. I am currently a senior at the University of Washington, Tacoma, 
        pursuing my Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science. I have a minor in Business Data Analytics, 
        leading me to be someone who is dedicated to leveraging data analytics to drive sustainable 
        business growth and inform strategic decisions.
      </p>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I have two children, a 5 year old daughter and a 1 year old son. There are many hobbies I enjoy 
        such as rock climbing, soccer, and video games. Since I grew up surrounded by technology, my 
        father and siblings were always deeply engaged with computers and how they worked, and 
        naturally, I followed their lead. From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by how computers 
        operate and how meaningful insights can be created from the data they provide. This curiosity 
        has evolved into a passion for using technology and data to develop innovative ideas and make 
        informed decisions about the future.

Java, SQL, Python, R
### Frameworks
MySQL, RapidMiner
### Developer Tools
Git, IntelliJIDEA, Eclipse, AIStudio, Maven

## Experience
I have developed substantial experience through a wide range of coding projects at the University of Washington Tacoma. These projects have strengthened my understanding of object-oriented programming, design patterns, and database implementation across multiple programming languages. They have also provided practical, hands-on exposure to building software systems, collaborating in team environments, and applying theoretical concepts to real world problems.

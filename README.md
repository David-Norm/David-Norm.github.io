# David Norman's Portfolio

## Overview

<table>
<tr>
<td width="55%" valign="top">

### Introduction
My name is David Norman. I am currently a senior at the University of Washington, Tacoma, pursuing my Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science. I also hold a minor in Business Data Analytics, which strengthens my ability to leverage data to drive sustainable business growth and support strategic decision-making.

### About Me
I grew up surrounded by technology. My father and siblings were always deeply engaged with computers, and naturally, I followed their lead. From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by how computers operate and how meaningful insights can be drawn from the data they produce. This curiosity has evolved into a passion for using technology and analytics to develop innovative ideas and make informed decisions about the future.
